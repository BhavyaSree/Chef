Chef is a automation tool that provides a way to define Infrastructure as Code.  

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is nothing but managing infrastructure by writing code (Automating infrastructure)
rather than using manual processes.  

Chef uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configurations.  

Two types of patterns of Programming.  
* Imperative
* Declarative

There are two models of configuration mangement tools. They are  
* Push based
* Pull based

In a `Push based model`, the master server pushes the configurations and softwares to the individual servers.  
Eg: Ansible, SaltStack 

In a `pull based model`, the individual servers contact the master server, establish a connection, download the 
configurations and softwares and then configures themselves accordingly.   
Configuration pull is initiated by the agent at regular intervals. 
Eg: Puppet, Chef   

Two fundamental characteristics of automation tools.   
* Idempotency
* Convergence   

Idempotent task is the one that yields the same result when repeated multiple times.  

`Idempotency` is an operation that leaves the system unmodified if itâ€™s already in the desired state.   
`Convergence` is the property of a system of not making unnecessary changes (nor operations). 
The end result of the both are same.  

`Chef` takes `idempotent` actions to `converge` the system to the state declared by the various resources.   
Every resource in Chef is declarative, and performs a test about the current state of the resource, 
and then repairs the system to match that.
