title: introducing chef
---

The foundation of chef was established in 2008 as `OPSCODE` which later on renamed to `chef`.  

Today, chef as a company offers multiple products, such as
* Chef (Infrastructure automation tool)
* Inspec
* Habitat

Chef is Ruby based, system automation friendly, IT automation tool used to configure, manage, deploy and 
orchestrate various applications are services across our entire infrastructure.  

The earliest version of chef open source project was released in 2009 by 'Adam Jacob' and his team.  

Chef comes with two deployment models.  
* Server-Client deployment model
* Chef zero (Self contained/stand alone) deployment model.   

`Server-Client` is a deployment model used in production use cases.  
Developers use simplified development model `chef-zero` for developments, testing and for proof of concepts.  

Chef supports various operating systems.    
* Chef server - Linux Only
* Chef Client - Linux and Windows.

### Why Chef?

* Chef is Declarative
* Consistent Delivery
* Chef is highly scalable with any cloud environments.
* Increased productivity
* Simplicity

Chef Uses declarative programming approach used its ruby based language.  
When it comes to creating, reading, updating and maintaining configuration codes on the system, we will
find declarative methods to be much simpler and easier than native scripting language.  

The primary responsibility of Chef is to maintain defined state or sometimes called as desired state
configuration.

### To install, configure and start the httpd

```ruby
# webserver package installation
package 'httpd' do
  action :install
end

# webserver file configuration
file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
  content: "This is my chef configured webserver file\n"
  action: create
end

# webserver service startup
service 'httpd' do
  action :start
end
```

### Deployment Model - Server/Client

The server is a Linux based machine where we install the Chef server software.   
The host is primarily responsible for maintaining configurations or recipes in the form of Chef codes.   
The clients also known as nodes are the target machines managed by Chef with the Chef client software installed on them.

These can be all different servers in our environment that we wish to manage using Chef.  
If anything needs to be updated the client pulls the necessary Chef codes from the Chef server and performs specific actions.   
This is known as a pull based mechanism. As in this case, the client is pulling for updates and pulling codes from the master node.   

The chief server can only be Linux.  The clients can be Linux or Windows.  

### Deployment Model - ChefZero or chef self contained server.

Chefzero acts a server and client on a single host.  

## Chef Architecture

The Chef architecture is divided into three major sections.
1. Chef Workstation.  
2. Chef Server.
3. chef Clients.  

Chef workstation is a local development platform for Chef users to create, test, apply and upload Chef codes.   
Chef workstation can be our local desktop with the Chef development kit software installed on it.   
The Chef DK contains multiple tools like Chef Apply, Chef Client, Kitchen, Inspec, Knife etc. that can
be used for connecting to a Chef server, managing code and dependencies or ensuring the quality of the
code that we write.  
This machine could be used as Chef Zero in development environment to test and validate Chef codes before
promoting them to production.   

Chef server is a node, having Chef server software installed and configured.   
This machine is responsible for managing the Chef code and acts as a hub for configuration data.  
Chef workstation pushes the Cookbooks to the Chef server.   

The Chef Client communicates with the Chef Server for configuration details such as the Chef code and 
other dependent files in binaries.   
The nodes pull the required configuration and files from the Chef Server and applies them locally.  

## Chef Server Offerings

* Open source version with limited features - Chef Server
* On-Perm enterprise Chef - Chef server with support and premium Features
* Multi-tenant Cloud solution - Hosted Chef server
Hosted chef server is the quickest and easiest option to get started with.  
This offering is free for a limited number of nodes.   

### Pre-requisites

* Network Connectivity and Supported browser.
* Supported Platform RHEL | CentoS | SUSE | Ubuntu (No windows Support)
* Persistent Hostname 
  Configure a fully qualified domain name for Chef Server and make it persistent across reboots by 
  amending an entry in hosts file.
* Firewall settings - Chef server must allow incoming connections on Port 80 and  443.
* System Requirements - 4vCPU, 4-8GB RAM
* Time Sync between chef server and client.
